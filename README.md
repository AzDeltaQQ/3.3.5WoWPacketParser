VERY BASIC IMPLEMENTATION OF A WOW 3.3.5A PACKET PARSER WITH A GUI USING FRIDA AND PYQT FOR GUI ... 

pip install -r requirements.txt

python wow_packet_viewer_gui.py

you must run and attach to wow before you log in to your account due to the server client handshake to get the keys to decode packets... (afaik atleast) it works this way.
